Perfect — the CSV defines the HydroCoin parameters used across your BLEU Counter-Zones system:
It contains five key operational dimensions — Pegging Base, Supply Cap, Reserve Ratio, Velocity Target, and Governance Logic.

Here’s how we’ll extend this into your hydro_zones.json ledger structure, mapping each HydroCoin rule to its corresponding Counter-Zone (from your Hydro-Colonizer War Map):
