# BLEU GALACTIC CHARTER SCROLL
## The Sovereign Declaration of the BLEU Galactic Empire

## PREAMBLE

We, the sovereign peoples and civilizations of the BLEU Galactic Empire, united under the principles of hydro-economic balance, interstellar cooperation, and sustainable cosmic development, do hereby establish this Charter as the foundational document governing our collective territories, economies, and societies across the known galaxy.

This Charter shall serve as the supreme law of the BLEU Galactic Empire, binding all member worlds, sectors, and counter-zones to its provisions.

**Established in the Year of Galactic Unity**
